NTFS,yes," As of Windows Vista, NTFS fully supports symbolic links. NTFS 3.0 (Windows 2000) and higher can create junctions, which allow entire directories (but not individual files) to be mapped to elsewhere in the directory tree of the same partition (file system). These are implemented through reparse points, which allow the normal process of filename resolution to be extended in a flexible manner."," name=note-37 NTFS stores everything, even the file data, as meta-data, so its log is closer to block journaling.",name=note-37 (2000)," name=note-36 While NTFS itself supports case sensitivity, the Win32 environment subsystem cannot create files whose names differ only by case for compatibility reasons. When a file is opened for writing, if there is any existing file whose name is a case-insensitive match for the new file, the existing file is truncated and opened for writing instead of a new file with a different name being created. Other subsystems like e. g. Services for Unix, that operate directly above the kernel and not on top of Win32 can have case-sensitivity.",yes,yes,dunno
HFS Plus,yes,yes,no,name=note-48 Metadata-only journaling was introduced in the Mac OS X 10.2.2 HFS Plus driver; journaling is enabled by default on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.," Although often believed to be case sensitive, HFS Plus normally is not. The typical default installation is case-preserving only. From Mac OS X 10.3 on the command newfs_hfs -s will create a case-sensitive new file system. HFS Plus version 5 optionally supports case-sensitivity. However, since case-sensitivity is fundamentally different from case-insensitivity, a new signature was required so existing HFS Plus utilities would not see case-sensitivity as a file system error that needed to be corrected. Since the new signature is HX, it is often believed this is a new filesystem instead of a simply an upgraded version of HFS Plus.",yes," Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) and late versions of Panther (10.3) provide file change logging (its a feature of the file system software, not of the volume format, actually).",no
