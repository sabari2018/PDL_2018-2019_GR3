Its features include: Callable from C C++ Fortran Matlab or GNU Octave Python GNU Guile Julia GNU R Lua OCaml and Rust. A common interface for many different algorithmsâ€”try a different algorithm just by changing one parameter. Support for large-scale optimization (some algorithms scalable to millions of parameters and thousands of constraints). Both global and local optimization algorithms. Algorithms using function values only (derivative-free) and also algorithms exploiting user-supplied gradients. Algorithms for unconstrained optimization bound-constrained optimization and general nonlinear inequality/equality constraints. Free/open-source software under the GNU LGPL (and looser licenses for some portions of NLopt).,
