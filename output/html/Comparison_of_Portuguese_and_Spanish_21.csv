d,[d ~ ð],[d ~ ð] (European Portuguese) [d ~ dʒ] (European Portuguese)," In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is Lenition after a Lenition. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have Lenition allophones, happening when before a Lenition /i/ ([Lenition ~ Lenition], [Lenition ~ Lenition], mainly in Brazil), or an Lenition /ɨ/ ~ /e̞/ ~ /ɪ/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /ɨ/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to Lenition ([dVz] → [Lenition], [dVs] → [Lenition], [tVs] → [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal). "
t,[t],[t] (European Portuguese)  [t ~ tʃ] (European Portuguese),
g,[ɡ ~ ɣ],[ɡ ~ ɣ] (European Portuguese) [ɡ] (European Portuguese),In Spanish and European Portuguese /ɡ/ is Lenition after a Lenition.
- l,[l],[ɫ] (European Portuguese) [w] (European Portuguese)," In European Portuguese syllable-final /l/ is velarized [Velarized alveolar lateral approximant] as in Velarized alveolar lateral approximant (see Velarized alveolar lateral approximant), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to [Velarized alveolar lateral approximant].  Caipira  rhoticizes to English-like ar, while  portunhol da pampa  velarizes it. "
"  r- ,  -rr- ",[r],[ʁ]," In Portuguese,  r-  and  -rr-  have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a Guttural R as in Guttural R ([ʀ], [ʁ] and [χ] in Portugal and Brazil, [x], [ɣ], [ħ], [h] and [ɦ] in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a Guttural R [Guttural R] (like in Guttural R). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final  -r  may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like [Guttural R], [Guttural R] or [Guttural R] is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish,  r-  and  -rr-  have kept their original pronunciation as an Guttural R [Guttural R]. Intervocalic  -r-  is an Guttural R in both languages [Guttural R]. "
v,[b ~ β],[v]," Originally, the letters ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩ stood for distinct sounds pronounced [Voiced bilabial plosive] and [Voiced bilabial plosive], respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single Voiced bilabial plosive in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the Voiced bilabial plosive [β] of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the Voiced bilabial plosive [Voiced bilabial plosive], as in French and Voiced bilabial plosive.
