Regarding the domestic use of Low carbon economy, Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building a nuclear waste repository in Nevada and has called for the facility's closure.Low carbon economy However, Obama voted for the Low carbon economy, which allocated $4.3 billion in tax credits to the nuclear energy sector.Low carbon economyLow carbon economy Obama and other Senators introduced a bill in 2007 to promote the development of commercially viable Low carbon economy and other electric-drive vehicles in order to shift away from petroleum fuels and ""toward much cleaner – and cheaper – electricity for transportation"".Low carbon economy In his plan, related with transportation, he proposes increase Low carbon economy 4 percent per each year, specific focus on R&amp;D in advanced battery technology and a $7,000 Low carbon economy for the purchase of advanced technology vehicles as well as conversion tax credits and $4 billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers; the entire White House fleet would be converted to plug-ins and half of cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in (hybrids or all-electric) vehicles by 2012.Low carbon economy ",
