Definition," In Java, the enumeration type is a Class (computer programming), and its values are Class (computer programming) (instances) of that class. The only valid values are the ones listed in the enumeration. The enumeration type may declare Class (computer programming), allowing each individual enumerated value to reference additional data associated uniquely with that specific value. The enumeration type may also declare or override Class (computer programming), or implement Class (computer programming).Class (computer programming) "," Enumeration in C# are implicitly derived from the Enum type that again is a value type derivative. The value set of a C# enumeration is defined by the  underlying type  that can be a signed or unsigned integer type of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. The enumeration definition defines names for the selected integer values.EnumerationEnumeration By default the first name is assigned the value 0 (zero) and the following names are assigned in increments of 1. Any value of the underlying primitive type is a valid value of the enumeration type, though an explicit cast may be needed to assign it. "
Combining,Java enumeration set and map collections provide functionality to combine multiple enumeration values to a combined value. These special collections allows compiler optimization to minimize the overhead incurred by using collections as the combination mechanism.,C# supports bit-mapped enumerations where an actual value may be a combination of enumerated values bitwise or'ed together. The formatting and parsing methods implicitly defined by the type will attempt to use these values.
