Color depth,24-bit per pixel resolution; offers better resolution for Grayscale," 6 to 10-bit per subpixel panels;Dot pitch smaller Dot pitch, better detailDot pitch ",6 to 8-bit per subpixel panels," 8 to 10-bit per subpixel, with some HDR models capable of 12-bit per subpixel.[11] "
Response time,0.01 ms[12] to less than 1 µs[13]," 1–8 ms typical (according to manufacturer data), older units could be as slow as 35 ms[14] "," Typically less than 0.001 ms, as low as 0.00001 ms[12] ",Estimates varying from under 0.01 ms to as low as 0.001 ms.[15][16]
Frame rate," 60–85 fps typically, some CRTs can go even higher (200 fps at reduced resolution[17]); internally, display refreshed at input frame rate speed "," 60 fps typically, gaming monitors can do up to 240 fps; internally, display refreshed at up to 240 Hz[18] "," 60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps; internally, display refreshed at e.g. 480 or 600 Hz[19] ",60 fps typically.
Flicker (screen),Perceptible on lower refresh rates (60 Hz and below)[20]," Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use Pulse-width modulation (Pulse-width modulation) to dim the backlightPulse-width modulation ",Does not normally occur due to high refresh rate.[22],Does not normally occur.

Energy consumption and heat generation,High[25],Low[25],Varies with brightness but usually higher than LCD[26][27][28][29]," Varies based on image brightness and color. For the majority of images it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD. OLED displays use 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black as they lack the need for a Backlight,Backlight while OLED can use more than three times as much power to display a mostly white image compared to an LCD.Backlight    "
Environmental influences," Sensitive to ambient magnetic fields, which can adversely affect convergence and color purity. ",Prone to malfunctions on both low (below -4 °F/-20 °C) or high (above 45 °C/113 °F) temperatures[32],High altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises[33],Can have poor brightness.
Electro-magnetic radiation emission,Can emit a small amount of X-ray radiation.,Only emits Non-ionizing radiation.Non-ionizing radiation,Emits strong Radio frequency electromagnetic radiationRadio frequency,
Size," Up to 43"" (1.09 m) "," Up to 108"" (2.78 m)[36] "," Up to 150"" (3.8 m)[37] "," Up to 88"" (2.24 m)[38] "
Maintenance," Hazardous to repair or service due to high-voltage,  requires skilled convergence calibration and adjustments for geographic location changes.[39] Glass display tube is evacuated and carries risk of implosion if improperly handled. ",Risky and expensive to repair due to complexity of the display;Mercury (element) units with Mercury (element) lamps are a minor environmental health hazardMercury (element),Screen itself cannot be repaired if the gas used to generate images leaks[42],
Other," No Native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling).Native resolution Native resolution is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.Native resolution Extremely bulky and heavy construction in comparison to other display technologies. Large displays would be unsuitable for wall mounting. New models are no longer produced. "," The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality. [45]   Is the cheapest display technology currently produced, with some entry-level models selling for less than $100. "," Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes. [46] New models are no longer produced. "," Coloured sub-pixels may age at different rates, leading to a colour shift. Sensitive to UV light from direct sunlight. Is considered the highest quality but also the most expensive display technology currently produced, with products rarely being available for less than $1000. "
