Type of reactor," RBMK-1000 RBMK, 2nd generation reactor without containment",Boiling water reactor and Boiling water reactor reactors with Boiling water reactor containment vessels
Number of reactors,4 on site; 1 involved in accident,6 on site; 4 (and Spent fuel pool) involved in accident; one of the four reactors was empty of fuel at the time of the accident.
Amount of nuclear fuel in affected reactors,1 reactor - 210 tons (spent fuel pools not involved in incident)[2]," 4 reactors - 854 tons (81 tons in Unit 1 reactor, 111 tons in Unit 2 reactor, 111 tons in Unit 3 reactor, 0 tons in Unit 4 reactor (defueled), 59 tons in Unit 1 spent fuel pool (SFP), 119 tons in Unit 2 SFP, 104 tons in Unit 3 SFP, and 269 tons in Unit 4 SFP)[a] "
Cause of the accident," Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive Void coefficient and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became Void coefficient. This was followed by a Void coefficient that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a Void coefficient. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the Void coefficient moderator that made up most of the core was involved. See Void coefficient, Note 1, for more discussion."," The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large Tsunami. Subsequent review did not lead to mitigation. A major Tsunami caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic Tsunami casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including Tsunami and explosive loss of Tsunami.[ Tsunami ] "
Maximum level of Radiation detected,300 Sievert/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.Sievert,530 Sievert/h inside Unit 2 containment vessel in 2017 according to Japan Times.Sievert
Radioactivity released," According to IAEA, total release was 14 EBq (14,000 PBq).[8] 5.2 EBq (5,200 PBq) in iodine-131 equivalent [9][10]"," As of 2014, a peer reviewed estimate of the total was 340–780 PBecquerel, with 80% falling into the Pacific Ocean.Becquerel Radiation continues to be released into the Pacific via groundwater. "
Area affected," An area up to 500 kilometres (310 mi) away contaminated, according to the United Nations.[12][13][14]"," Radiation levels exceeding annual limits seen over 60 kilometres (37 mi) to northwest and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to south-southwest, according to officials.[ Wikipedia:Citation needed ] "
Exclusion Zone Area,30 km," 20 km (30 km voluntary) extending north-west to 45 km in the downwind direction to Iitate, FukushimaIitate, Fukushima "
Population relocated," 335,000 (About 115,000 from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986; about 220,000 people from Belarus, the Belarus and Belarus after 1986)"," 154,000[16] "
Population returned,None," 122,000[17] "
Direct fatalities from the accident,Two immediate trauma deaths; 28 deaths from Acute Radiation Syndrome out of 134 showing symptoms; four from an industrial accident (helicopter crash); 15 deaths from radiation-genic thyroid cancers (as of 2005);Acute Radiation Syndrome as many as 4000 to 90000 cancer related deaths.Acute Radiation Syndrome,None
Current status," All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the  Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus . A Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus structure was installed in November 2016, from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned."," Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011, but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years.Cold shutdownCold shutdown All fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed. Cold shutdown is ongoing. "
